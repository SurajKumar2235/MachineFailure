# MACHINE FAILURE

1. Explored and built a predictive model that led to machine failure such
as Air temperature, process temperature, rotation speed, torque using
PCA, Data Visualization, Logistic Regression.
2. Prepared Data for Model training
3. I have got following accuracy

    a.  Logistic Regression Accuracy: 0.966
   <br />
    b.  Decision Tree Accuracy:       0.981
   <br />
    c.  Random Forest Accuracy:       0.988
   <br />
    d.  XGBoost Accuracy:             0.9875
